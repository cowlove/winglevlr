AHRSD0037 	4/19	constant bank turns, at this point the plane had large servo trim and no PID-I correction
AHRSD0038	4/19	orbit.sh 
AHRSD0039	4/19 	two long straight stretches 
AHRSD0042	4/20	manual bank 0, started with large mechanical trim offset, let PID-I controller tune it in
AHRSD0043		manual bank 0, but with mechanical trim tuned in
AHRSD0044		manual bank circles, 12 degrees
AHRSD0045		manual bank circles, 25 degrees
47		straight NAV GDL90
48		straight nav fused
49		straight nav gdl90 again 

52		orbit.sh at 12 and 22 deg 


55		100ms	  ./roll.sh 055 -galt -gpspitch -calcpitch -pitcherr -pulse -relay
57		120ms 
60 		80ms pitch servo pulses
61		60ms pitch servo pulses
62		50ms pitch servo pulses
63 		50ms again
64		40ms
67 		spotty GPS, lost its mind (found hdg 0/360 discontinuouty bug)  ./roll.sh 067 -roll -hdgGPS -dtk -desroll
68  	iFly GPS enabled, comparison of GDL90, VTG and RMC gps sources:  ./roll.sh 068 -hdgGDL90 -hdgVTG -hdgRMC
		or use as regression ./loglook.sh 068 -calcroll -calcservo -calcpitch -pulse
